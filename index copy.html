        <p>
            I have been working on a custom resource pack for modded Minecraft that implement's a few of the
            best 16x16 textures (including most if not all of Jappa's new 1.14.x textures) into a pack I've
            called "Voidpack". I have made a few textures, but by no means to I claim ownership of them all. You
            can check it out and download it <span class="voidpack" for-modal="voidpack">here!</span>
        </p>
